# Advanced JavaScript + Node.js Deep Dive (8 Weeks)

This repository contains an 8-week structured learning plan to master advanced
JavaScript and Node.js topics including engine internals, async concurrency,
functional programming, streams, architecture, security, scaling, and
deployment.

## 📆 Weekly Structure
Each week includes:
- Topics (theory)
- Coding exercises
- Example demos
- One mini-project
- Documentation & notes

## 📁 Folder Overview
- Week-XX-*   → Weekly learning modules
- projects/   → All mini-projects
- docs/       → Notes, diagrams & cheatsheets
- scripts/    → Benchmark & profiling tools

## 🚀 Goal
By the end of the program, you will be able to:
- Understand internals of JS & Node
- Build high-performance backend systems
- Handle streams, backpressure, workers, clusters
- Apply architecture patterns (DDD, clean architecture)
- Write production-ready, testable, scalable Node APIs
